# LeetCode Solutions

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a platform for practicing coding problems, algorithm challenges, and data structures. These solutions are meant to showcase my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.

Please note that the code provided here is for educational purposes, and it's important to understand the problem and come up with your own solutions before referring to the code. Learning through practice and problem-solving is key to improving your coding skills.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a LeetCode problem. Inside each problem folder, you'll typically find the following:

- **Solution File(s)**: These are the code files with my solutions to the problem. I strive to provide clear and well-documented code to explain the thought process and approach used to solve the problem.

- **README.md**: This file provides a detailed description of the problem statement, the approach taken to solve it, and any special considerations or insights about the problem.

## How to Use

To access the solution for a specific problem, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the corresponding problem folder.

2. Open the `README.md` file to understand the problem statement, approach, and any specific notes.

3. You can view the code solution in the provided file(s).

4. If needed, you can run the code locally using your preferred programming language.
